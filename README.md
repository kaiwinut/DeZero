# DeZero
Deep learning framework from scratch following the book "Deep Learning From Scratch", by Goki Saito.

## Examples
###### Training an MLP on the spiral dataset

## Progress

### Step 36 ~ Step 48
Added layers, optimizers, models, etc.. Based on which, we implemented a basic MLP model to train on the spiral dataset.

### Step 24 ~ Step 35
Made the full version core of the DeZero framework based on the simple version completed in previous steps. DeZero now supports high-order auto-differentiation.

### Step 01 ~ Step 23
Completed a simple version of the core of the DeZero framework. DeZero now supports backbropagation by auto-differentiation and fundamental calculations using basic math symbols, e.g. +, -, *, /, etc..
